Sonic The Hedgehog a series well know by many people

Is and will ALWAYS be associated by SEGA I have no

owns to ANY music or characters/names all will be under

SEGA'S rights i have absolutely 0 owns to these copyright

claims and if i get any strikes I will not defend

as SEGA can do what they want to their assets, music,

and even character/names. thank you so much,

now that thats out of the way...these assets

will be for an alpha prototype build and will not

be the finished data, and please don't be rude

I will have tried my best (THIS WILL BE DONE IN UNITY)

it will consist of maybe 4 levels,(one act though)

classic genesis music, and all new

sonic sprites by me! Remember if you wanna report bugs/glitches ect.

please send it to my email (elvisgaitan12@gmail.com)

and i will get onto it as soon as possible!
